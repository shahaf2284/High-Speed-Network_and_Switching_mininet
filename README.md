# High-Speed-Network_and_Switching_mininet
High Speed Network and Switching 

Module's Description:
The project will explore the architecture of network elements used in high speed networks, provide the survey of
modern network protocols and discuss issues that face network architects who design and manage carrier networks.
Concepts will be illustrated by examples from Linux Networking Stack.

Aims of the module: 
The exponential increase of Internet and multimedia applications has accelerated research, development and deployment 
of high-speed networks. The course will provide understanding of key issues in network and network 
elements architectures, protocols and algorithms used in high-speed networks with some emphasis on switching and traffic management.
